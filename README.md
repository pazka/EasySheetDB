# EasySheetDB

The goal is for me to be able to create single API service to easly fetch data from various google sheets.

Those google sheets will be accessible by my clients so that they have a familiar and simple interface to update their data.

## Access point

The access point is the following:

`easysheetdb.hosh.it/<projectname>/

## credentials

need a file called `accountkey.json` generated from the google workspace from your project to be able to function
